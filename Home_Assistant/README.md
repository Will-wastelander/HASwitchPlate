# Home Assistant configurations

These folders contain a ready-to-run Home Assistant configuration for testing and demonstration. 3 dimmable lights are defined to demonstrate device control, some weather sensors are defined to show status output, and the [Google Desktop Music Player](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.gpmdp/) component is included to demonstrate media player controls.

[Check the documentation](../Documentation/05_Home_Assistant.md) for deployment details.

This setup utilizes [Home Assistant packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) for easy deployment.
